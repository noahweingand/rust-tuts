Chapter 4 - Understanding Ownership

Ownership is Rust's most unique feature, and it enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees
without needing a garbage collector. 

4.1 What is Ownership?
    - All programs manage the way they use a computer's memory while running. Some languages
      have garbage collection that constantly looks for no longer used memory as the programs
      runs; others, the programmer must explicity allocate and free the memory. 
    - Rust's memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the compiler
      checks at compile time. None of the ownership features slow down your program while it's
      running.

The Stack and the Heap
    - In most programming languages, you don't have to think about the stack and heap. In Rust,
      whether a value is on the stack or the heap has more of an effect on how the language 
      behaves and why you have to make certain decisions.
    - The stack stores values in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite
      order (LIFO). All data stored on stack must have a known, fixed size.
    - Data with an unknown size at compile time or a size that might change must be stored on the
      heap instead. The heap is less organized: when you put data on the heap, you request a
      certain amount of space. The OS finds an empty spot in the heap that's big enough, marks
      it as being in use, and returns a pointer, which is the address of that location. This
      process is called 'allocating on the heap'. The pointer is a known, fixed size so you
      can store the pointer on the stack. When you want the actual data, you must follow
      the pointer.
    - Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the OS never has to
      search for a place to store new data; that location is always at the top of the stack.
      Comparatively, allocating space on the heap requires more work, because the OS must
      first find a big enough space to hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare
      for the next allocation. 
    - Accessing data in the heap is slower than accessing data on the stack because you
      have to follow a pointer to get there.

Ownership Rules 
    1. Each value in Rust has a variable that's called its owner.
    2. There can only be one owner at a time.
    3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

    - Scope: range within a program for which an item is valid (nothing new here).
    - All types covered previously are all stored on the stack and popped when scope is over.
    - We'll look at Strings.
    - String literals aren't suitable for every situation when using text. One reason is that
      they're immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write
      our code (i.e. user input).
    - There is a second string type, String. This type is allocated on the heap and can store
      an amount of text that's unknown at compile time. These kind of strings can be mutated.

Memory and Allocation 
    - string literals are known at compile time which is why they're fast and efficient. Those
      properties come from its immutability. Using String, we need to allocate an amount of memory
      on the heap, unknown at compile time, to hold the contents. Which means: The memory must
      be requested from the OS at runtime, AND we need a way of returning this memory to the OS
      when we're done with our String. Without a garbage collector, we have to manage 
      memory ourselves. 
    - Memory is automatically returned once the variable that owns it goes out of scope.
    - Know of the 'double free' memory bug (referenced in this chapter's code).
    - Know of 'moving' data from variables. Rust will never automatically create "deep" copies
      of your data. Therefore, any automatic copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms
      of runtime performance. 
    - If we do want a "deep" copy of a String on the heap data, not just the stack data, we can
      use 'clone'.
    
    - With functions, passing strings into functions moves them out of scope of where they were.
      With integers, they remain in scope.
